# gfmjs

`gfmjs` is a JavaScript test runner for GitHub Flavored Markdown files. It extracts JavaScript code blocks, transforms `// => expected` style comments into actual assertions, and executes the code, reporting syntax errors, runtime errors, and failed assertions.

Inspired by [`jsmd`](https://github.com/vesln/jsmd).

## features

Single-line `// => expected` and Block/Multi-line comments `/* => expected */`. are supported.
Newlines, extra lines, and spaces are fine.

```js
const x = 123

x // => 123

x
// => 123

x
/*
	=>
		123
*/
```

Any expression should work as an expected value.

```js
const expected = [ 1, 2, 3 ]
const foo = value => {
	value // => expected.shift()
}
foo(1)
foo(2)
foo(3)
```

It has a sourcemap back to the original markdown file so errors should include the original location.

CommonJS and/or ESM modules can be required or imported.

## usage

```sh
$ gfmjs ./README.md
```

```sh
# write the javascript bundle to a file
$ gfmjs -o ./build/README.js ./README.md
```

Code blocks that are tagged as `js` or `javascript` will be evaluated.

	```js
		// code here
	```
	```javascript
		// code here
	```

You can also make hidden code blocks that will be evaluated by using html comments tagged in the same manner:
```html
<!--js
	// code here
-->
```

If you want to write visible javascript code blocks that won't be evaluated but will be styled, tag them as `node`:

	```node
		// code here
	```
